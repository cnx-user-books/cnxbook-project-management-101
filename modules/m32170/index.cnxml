    <para id="id1164247846432">After the project has been defined and the project team has been appointed, you are ready to enter the second phase in the project management life cycle: the detailed <emphasis effect="italics">project planning</emphasis> phase. </para>
    <para id="id1164272614158">Project planning is the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. The planning phase is where the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements defined, and the project schedule created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the execution and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help you to manage time, cost, quality, change, risk and related issues. It will also help you manage staff and external suppliers, to ensure that you deliver the project on time and within schedule. </para>
    <para id="id1164228819168">The project planning phase is often the most challenging phase for a project manager, as you need to make an educated guess of the staff, resources and equipment needed to complete your project. You may also need to plan your communications and procurement activities, as well as contract any 3rd party suppliers.</para>

    <para id="id1164266759369">The planning phase refines the project’s objectives gathered during the <emphasis effect="italics">initiation phase</emphasis> and plans the steps necessary to meet those objectives by further identifying the specific activities and resources required to complete the project. Now that these objectives have been recognized, they must be clearly articulated entailing an in-depth scrutiny of the recognized objective. With such scrutiny, our understanding of the objective will change. Often the very act of trying to describe something precisely gives us a better understanding of what we are looking at. This articulation serves as the basis for the development of requirements. What this means is that after an objective has been clearly articulated (clearly stated) we can go about the business of stipulating in concrete terms what we have to do to achieve it. Obviously, if we do a poor job of articulating the objective, our requirements will be misdirected and the resulting project will not represent the true need. </para>
    <para id="id1164242126357">Users will often begin describing their objectives in qualitative language. The project manager must work with the user to provide quantifiable definitions to those qualitative terms. These quantifiable criteria include: schedule, cost, and quality measures. In the case of project objectives, these elements are used as measurements to determine project satisfaction and successful completion. Subjective evaluations can be removed with actual numbers. </para>
    
    <example id="eip-333"><para id="eip-555">
  A web user may ask for a <emphasis effect="italics">fast system</emphasis>. The quantitative example would be <emphasis effect="italics">all screens must load in under 3 seconds</emphasis>. Describing the time limit in which the screen must load is specific and tangible. For that reason, you’ll know that the requirement has been completed when the objective has been met. 
</para>
</example>
    <example id="eip-454"><para id="eip-900">
 Let’s say your company is going to produce a run of holiday eggnog. Your objective statement might be stated this way: <emphasis effect="italics">Christmas Cheer, Inc. will produce two million cases of holiday eggnog to be shipped to our distributors by October 30 at a total cost of $1.5 million or less</emphasis>. The objective criteria in this statement are clearly stated and fulfillment of the project objective can be easily measured. Stakeholders will know the objective is met when the two million cases are produced and shipped by the due date within the budget stated. 
</para>
</example><para id="id1164258176395">When articulating the project objectives you should follow the SMART rule:</para>
    <list id="id1164259153286" list-type="bulleted">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">S</emphasis>pecific (get into the details). Objectives should be specific and written in clear, concise, and understandable terms.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">M</emphasis>easurable (use qualitative language so you know when you are finished). A requirement must have a measurable outcome; otherwise you will not be able to determine when you have delivered it.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">A</emphasis>cceptable (to stakeholders). </item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">R</emphasis>ealistic (in terms of achievement). Objectives that are impossible to accomplish are not realistic and not attainable. Objectives must be centered in reality.</item>

      <title>Scope planning</title>
      <para id="id1164262417106">You always want to know exactly what work has to be done to finish your project BEFORE you start it. You’ve got a collection of team members, and you need to know exactly what they’re going to do to build your product or meet the project’s objectives. The scope planning process if the very first thing you do to manage your scope. Project scope planning is concerned with defining all of the work of the project and only the work needed to successfully meet the project objectives. The whole idea here is that when you start the project, you need to have a clear picture of all the work that needs to happen on your project, and as the project progresses, you need to keep that scope up to date and written down in the project’s <emphasis effect="italics">scope management plan</emphasis>.</para>
      <section id="id1164271499518">
        <title>How do you define the scope?</title>
        <para id="id1164249013507">You already got a head start on refining the project’s objectives in quantifiable terms, but now you need to go a lot further and write down all of the deliverables that you and your team are going to produce over the course of the project. Deliverables include everything that you and your team produce for the project; anything that your project will deliver. The deliverables for your project include all of the products or services that you and your team are performing for the client, customer, or sponsor. But deliverables include more than that. They also include every single document, plan, schedule, budget, blueprint, and anything else that gets made along the way; including all of the project management documents you put together. Project deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be produced to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables like objectives must be specific and verifiable. </para>
        <para id="id1164224975937">All deliverables must be described in enough detail so that they can be differentiated from related deliverables. For example:</para>
        <list id="id1164231180198" list-type="bulleted">
          <item>A twin engine plane versus a single engine plane. </item>

          <item>A departmental solution versus an enterprise solution.</item>
        </list>
        <para id="id1164225709464">One of the project manager’s primary functions is to accurately document the deliverables and requirements of the project and then manage the project so that they are produced according to the agreed upon criteria. Deliverables describe the components of the goals and objectives in a quantifiable way. Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables. </para>

Requirements describe the characteristics of the deliverable. They may also describe functionality that the deliverable must have or specific conditions the deliverable must meet in order to satisfy the objective of the project.<emphasis effect="italics"/> A requirement is an objective that must be met. The project requirements defined in the <emphasis effect="italics">scope plan</emphasis> describe what a project is supposed to accomplish and how the project is supposed to be created and implemented. Requirements answer the following questions regarding the AS IS and TO BE states of the business: who, what where, when, how much, how does a business process work. </para>

If we go back to the example of the company producing holiday eggnog; one of the major deliverables is the cartons that hold the eggnog. The requirements for that deliverable may include carton design, photographs that will appear on the carton, color choices, etc. </para>
        <para id="id1164281253279">Requirements specify what the project deliverable should look like and what it should do. They can be divided into six basic categories, functional, non-functional, technical, user, business, and regulatory requirements. </para>

They are restrictions or constraints to be placed on the deliverable and how to build it. Their purpose is to restrict the number of solutions that will meet a set of requirements. Using the vehicle example (<link target-id="eip-438"/>); without any constraints, the functional requirement of a vehicle to take a load from a warehouse to a shop, the solutions being offered might result in anything from a large truck to a sports car!

Understanding the reasoning that used to arrive at a decision is critical in avoiding repetition. For example, if a particular feature has been excluded because it is simply not feasible, that fact needs to be recorded. If it is not, then the project risks wasted work and repetition when a stakeholder requests the feature be reinstated during development or testing.

      <title>Preparing the work breakdown structure</title>
      <para id="id1164225107416">Now that we have the deliverables and requirements well defined, the process of breaking down the work of the project via a work breakdown structure begins. The work breakdown structure (WBS) defines the scope of the project and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated and easily monitored and controlled. The idea behind the work breakdown schedule is simple. You subdivide a complicated task into smaller tasks, until you reach a level that cannot be further subdivided. Anyone familiar with the arrangements of folders and files in a computer memory, or who has researched their ancestral family free, should be familiar with this idea. You stop breaking down the work when you reach a low enough level to perform an estimate of the desired accuracy. At that point, it is usually easier to estimate how long the small task will take and how much it will cost to perform than it would have been to estimate these factors at the higher levels. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increased level of detailed definition of the project work.</para>
      <para id="id1164264122665">As an example, if I want to clean a room, I might begin by picking up clothes, toys, and other things that have been dropped on the floor. I could use a vacuum cleaner to get dirt out of the carpet. I might take down the curtains and take them to the cleaners, then dust the furniture. All of these tasks are subtasks performed to clean the room. As for vacuuming the room, I might have to get the vacuum cleaner out of the closet, connect the hose, empty the bag, and put the machine back in the closet. These are smaller tasks to be performed in accomplishing the subtask called vacuuming. The diagram in <link target-id="id1164231276487"/> shows how this might be portrayed in WBS format.</para>

      <para id="id1164271157510">It is very important to note that we do not worry about the sequence in which the work is performed or any dependencies between them when we do a WBS. That will be worked out when we develop the schedule. For example, under <emphasis effect="italics">3.0 Vacuum</emphasis> (in <link target-id="id1164231276487"/>), it would be obvious that <emphasis effect="italics">3.3 Vacuum carpet</emphasis> would be performed after <emphasis effect="italics">3.4 Connect hose and plug</emphasis>! However, you will probably find yourself thinking sequentially, as it seems to be human nature to do so. The main idea of creating a WBS is to capture all of the tasks, irrespective of their order. So if you find yourself and other members of your team thinking sequentially, don’t be too concerned, but don’t get hung up on trying to diagram the sequence or you will slow down the process of task identification. </para>
      <para id="id1164225171720">A WBS can be structured any way it makes sense to you and your project. In practice, the chart structure is used quite often (as in the example in <link target-id="id1164231276487"/>) but it can be composed in outline form as well (<link target-id="id1164237667331"/>).</para>

This unique identifier is typically a number, and it’s used to sum and track costs, schedules, and resources associated with WBS elements. These numbers are usually associated with the corporation’s chart of accounts, which is used to track costs by category. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the code of accounts.</para>
      <para id="id1164273596824">There are also many ways you can organize the WBS. For example, it can be organized by either deliverable or phase. The major deliverables of the project are used as the first level in the WBS.

The <emphasis effect="italics">project activity</emphasis> list is a list of everything that needs to be done to complete your project, including all the activities that must be accomplished to deliver the work package. Next you want to define the <emphasis effect="italics">activity attributes</emphasis>. Here’s where the description of each activity is kept. All of the information you need to figure out; the order of the work should be here too. So any <emphasis effect="italics">predecessor</emphasis> activities, successor activities or constraints should be listed in the attributes along with descriptions and any other information about resources or time that you need for planning. The three main kinds of predecessors are <emphasis effect="italics">finish-to-start</emphasis> (FS), <emphasis effect="italics">start-to-start</emphasis> (SS) and <emphasis effect="italics">finish-to-finish</emphasis> (FF).</para>
        <para id="id1164248111448">The most common kind of predecessor is the finish-to-start. It means that one task needs to be completed before another one can start.

Every activity in your activity list needs to have resources assigned to it. Before you can assign resources to your project, you need to know which ones you’re authorized to use; that’s called resource availability. Resource availability includes information about what resources you can use on your project and when they’re available to you. Don’t forget that some resources like consultants or training rooms have to be scheduled in advance, and they might only be available at certain times. You’ll need to know this before you can finish planning your project. If you are starting to plan in January, a June wedding is harder to plan than one in December, because the wedding halls are all booked up in advance. That is clearly a resource constraint. You’ll also need the activity list that you created earlier, and you’ll need to know about how your organization typically handles resources. Once you’ve got a handle on these things, you’re set for resource estimation. </para>

There are five tools and techniques for the activity resource estimating process. Some of them have technical sounding names, but they’re all actually pretty sensible when you think about it. They should make sense to you when you think about what you have to do when you have to figure out what resources your project needs.</para>

	<item><emphasis effect="bold">Bottom-up estimating</emphasis> means breaking down complex activities into pieces and working out the resource assignments for each piece. It is a process of estimating these individual activities or costs and then adding these up together to come up with a total estimate. Here you estimate every scheduled activity individually and then roll up that estimate; or add them all together, to come up with a total. Bottom-up estimating is a very accurate means of estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be accessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.</item>

          <item><emphasis effect="bold">Design of experiments</emphasis> is the list of all the kinds of tests you are going to run on your product. It might list all the kinds of test procedures you’ll do, the approaches you’ll take, and even the tests themselves. (In the software world, this is called test planning).</item>
          <item><emphasis effect="bold">Cost of quality</emphasis> is what you get when you add up the cost of all the prevention and inspection activities you are going to do on your project. It doesn’t just include the testing. It includes any time spent writing standards, reviewing documents, meeting to analyze the root causes of defects, re-work to fix the defects once they’re found by the team; absolutely everything you do to ensure quality on the project. </item>
        </list>
        <para id="id1164224223562">Cost of quality can be a good number to check whether your project is doing well or having trouble. Say your company tracks cost of quality on all of its projects. Then you could tell if you were spending more or less than they are to get your project up to quality standards.</para>
        <para id="id1164238117555">Once you have your quality plan, you know your guidelines for managing quality on your project. Your strategies for monitoring your project quality should be included in the plan, as well as the reasons for all the steps you are taking. It’s important that everyone on the team understand the rationale behind the metrics being used to judge success or failure of the project.</para>

      <title>Communication planning</title>
      <para id="id1164224948162">Communications management is about keeping everybody in the loop. Have you ever tried talking to someone in a really loud, crowded room? That’s what running a project is like if you don’t get a handle on communications. The communications planning process concerns defining the types of information you’re going to deliver, to whom, the format for communicating the information and when. It turns out that 90% of a project manager’s job is spent on communication so it’s important to make sure everybody gets the right message at the right time.</para>
      <para id="id1164271243747">The first step in defining your communication plan is figuring out what kind of communication your stakeholders need from the project so that they can make good decisions. This is called the <emphasis effect="italics">communications requirements analysis</emphasis>. Your project will produce a lot of information; you don’t want to overwhelm your stakeholders with all of it. Your job here is to figure out what they feel is valuable. Communicating valuable information doesn’t mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications to stakeholders may consist of either good news or bad news- the point is that you don’t want to bury stakeholders in too much information but give them enough so that they’re informed and can make appropriate decisions.</para>
      <para id="id1164236479460"><emphasis effect="italics">Communications technology</emphasis> has a major impact on how you can keep people in the loop. This examines the methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from and among the stakeholders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken, e-mail, formal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, project websites and so forth. You should consider several factors before deciding what methods you’ll choose to transfer information. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first factor. It’s a lot easier for people to get information on their projects if it’s accessible through a web site, than if all your information is passed around by paper memos. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or are there systems already in place that will work? The technologies available to you will definitely figure into your plan of how you will keep everyone notified of project status and issues. Staff experience with the technology is another factor. Are there project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technology, or will you need to train them? Finally, consider the duration of the project and the project environment. Will the technology you’re choosing work throughout the life of the project or will it have to be upgraded or updated at some point? And how does the project team function? Are they located together or spread out across several campuses or locations? The answers to these questions should be documented in the communication plan.</para>
      <para id="id1164225154491">All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The communication plan documents the types of information needs the stakeholders have, when the information should be distributed and how the information will be delivered.</para><para id="id1164234404454">The type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project scope statements, and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action items, performance measures, project acceptance and so on. What’s important to know now is that the information needs of the stakeholders should be determined as early in the planning phase of the project management lifecycle as possible so that as you and your team develop project planning documents, you already know who should receive copies of them and how they should be delivered.</para>

      <title>Bringing it all together</title>
      <para id="id1164282610705">Believe it or not, we have officially completed the <emphasis effect="italics">planning phase</emphasis> of the project management lifecycle. The project plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that’s used to guide you throughout the project <emphasis effect="italics">execution phase</emphasis>. The plan is made up of all the processes of the planning phase. It is the map that tells you where you’re going and how to perform the activities of the project plan during the project execution phase. It serves several purposes; the most important of which is tracking and measuring project performance. The project plan is critical in all communications you’ll have from here forward with the stakeholders, management, and customers. The project plan encompasses everything we talked about up to now and is represented in a formal document or collection of documents. This document contains the project scope, deliverables, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones, project schedule, resources, communication plan, the project budget and any procurement needs. It becomes the baseline you’ll use to measure and track progress against. It is also used to help you control the components that tend to stray away from the original plan so you can get them back on track. </para>
      <para id="id1164224894787">The project plan is used as a communication and information tool for stakeholders, team members and the management team. They will use the project plan to review and gauge progress as well. Your last step in the planning phase is obtaining sign-off of the project plan from stakeholders, the sponsor and the management team. If they’ve been an integral part of the planning processes all along (and I know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off of the project plan should simply be a formality.</para>
